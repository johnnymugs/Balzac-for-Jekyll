Here for posterity are two blog posts I wrote while working at Pivotal Labs.

[Lessons From the Beach](http://pivotallabs.com/lessons-from-the-beach/) - Some musings on being kind to the developer that will clean up after you.

[Welcome NYC Iron Bloggers](http://pivotallabs.com/welcome-nyc-iron-bloggers/) - Some thoughts on inspiration. Sadly enough, though I spear-headed the iron-blogger group at Pivotal, I only managed to squeeze out these few posts.
